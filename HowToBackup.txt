Note: These commands were selected so that two backups against the same database that has no changes
will produce the same file, byte-by-byte. This is important for the comparison tool to work correctly 
and not keep flagging the same backup data as different. As an example, SqlPackage creating .bacpac 
files will use random GUIDs in the output. The commands below have options set to avoid datestamps in 
output that would make two identical backups different.



For MYSQL:
	1. You'll need MySQL or MaraiaDB installed on your machine - you may be able to get mysqldump seperately from the full DB install.

	2. Run Example backup command to run with the following properties:
		Server: yourServer
		Username: yourUsername
		Password (Notice NO space between -p and the password): yourPassword
		Database Name: yourDatabaseName
		File To Write To: %filename%

		"c:\Program Files\MariaDb 10.6\bin\mysqldump" --no-tablespaces --hex-blob --max-allowed-packet=10554432 --skip-dump-date -h yourServer -u yourUsername -pyourPassword yourDatabaseName -r \"%filename%\"



For MSSQL:
	1. Install mssql-scripter (run cmd "pip install mssql-scripter" - it's a python program) https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-scripter/blob/dev/doc/installation_guide.md 

	2. The backup command to run with the following properties:
		Server: yourServer
		Username: yourUsername
		Password: yourPassword
		Database Name: yourDatabaseName
		File To Write To: %fileName%

	"C:\Python312\python" -X utf8 -m mssqlscripter -S yourServer -U yourUsername -P yourPassword -d yourDatabaseName --schema-and-data --exclude-types Database --exclude-use-database --exclude-headers -f "%fileName%"
